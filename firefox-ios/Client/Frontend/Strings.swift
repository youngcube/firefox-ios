///   - key: The key should be unique and composed of a relevant name, ended with the version the string was included in.
///   Example: `"FirefoxHomepage.Pocket.Sponsored.v103"` is a string that lives under the homepage for the sponsored content in the pocket
///   section, added in v103. The name is clear and explicit.
///   - tableName: The tablename defines the name of the table containing the localized string.
///   This specifically need to be defined for any strings that is part of the messaging framework, but since any string can be part of messaging in the
///   future all strings should have a tablename. This can be nil for existing strings, `new string shouldn't have a nil tableName`.
///   - value: The value is always the text that needs to be localized.  This can be nil for existing strings, `new string shouldn't have a nil value`.
///   - comment: The comment is an explanation aimed towards people that will translate the string value. Make sure it follow the l10n documentation

// This file contains all strings for Firefox iOS.

// To preserve a clean structure of this string file, we should organize them alphabetically,
// according to specific screens or feature, on that screen. Each string should
// be under a struct giving a clear indication as to where it is being used.
// In this case we will prefer verbosity for the sake of accuracy, over brevity.
// Sub structs may, and should, also be used to separate functionality where it makes
// sense, but efforts should be made to keep structs two levels deep unless there are
// good reasons for doing otherwise. As we continue to update strings, old strings may
// be present at the bottom of this file.
//
// Note that strings shouldn't be reused in multiple places in the application. Depending
// on the Locale we can't guarantee one string will be translated the same even if its value is the same.
